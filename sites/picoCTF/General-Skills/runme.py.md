## Solution

This is jsut a simple python script. we can run it with `python3 runme.py` and get the flag.

```bash
$ python3 runme.py

picoCTF{run_s4n1ty_run}
```

The goal of this challenge is to use `wget` to download the file. but we can also use the browser to download the file.

My Advice: try to use `wget` to download the file. and take this challenge as a practice for `wget`.
